        <div class="a4">
            <p>Sometimes, Internet users land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website can be used
                for both work and personal situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up to 13 hours on
                the site, Codepen for work and her hobby, which unfortunately, is also coding.<br><br>
                The designer, whose work includes a To-Do Terrarium, clarified, "Well, I didn't have to use it for work
                but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more efficient." The biggest issue,
                she said, is that she would hop on Codepen for work, but would get distracted by pens made by others in
                the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then causes her to spend even more time on
                the site.<br><br>
                "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands itself as the best place to build,
                test, and discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.</p>

                <p>Making a floor Plan with CSS Grid? Talk about using the wrong tool for the job. But I guess this is
                    what happens when someone isn't happy with any of the floor plans found on Pinterest; she'll start
                    making her own for the eventual home that she will never own. Nevertheless, there's a home office
                    with a large window to look out of pensively during rainy days and a ton of "white space" for the
                    cats to run around.</p>

                        Something's gotta change," says the designer, who has requested to remain anonymous.</p>

                    totally unbiased opinion, are the recreation of the Pac-Man layout and coupons inspired by junk
                    mail. A lot of joke items of things that shouldn't be done in CSS Grid, such as a shelf? Bathroom
                    tiles wtf? and makeup palettes . If you are a cultured person, you will have a chance to enjoy a
                    couple of pens inspired by Harry Potter and Pokemon. On the rare occasion that you are looking at
                    this profile for something you can use in production, you really shouldn't. But, there are some
                    real-world applications, such as the recipe layout, the product catalog, and color palettes for a
                    style guide.</p>
